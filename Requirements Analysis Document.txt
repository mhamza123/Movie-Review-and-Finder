2. Functional Requirements

2.1 User Registration and Authentication
1. Users should be able to register an account with the application.
2. Users should be able to log in and log out of their accounts securely.
3. Users should have the option to reset their passwords if forgotten.

2.2 Movie Search and Filtering
4. Users should be able to search for movies by title, genre, actors, and release year.
5. Users should be able to filter search results based on various criteria (e.g., genre, rating, release date).

2.3 Movie Details
6. Users should be able to view detailed information about a specific movie (e.g., synopsis, cast, crew, ratings).
7. Users should be able to view movie trailers if available.

2.4 Movie Reviews
8. Registered users should be able to submit reviews and ratings for movies.
9. Users should be able to view reviews and ratings submitted by other users.

13. Users should be able to like and comment on reviews.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

3.1 Performance
1. The application should have acceptable response times for search queries and movie details retrieval.
2. Performance optimization is not a priority for this basic project.

3.2 Security
3. Basic security measures should be implemented, such as encrypting passwords and handling basic authentication.

3.3 User Experience (UX)
4. The user interface should be simple and easy to navigate, prioritizing basic functionality over advanced design.

3.4 Scalability
5. The application does not need to handle a large number of users or movies; it is designed for a small-scale learning project.

3.5 Reliability
6. While errors should be handled gracefully, the focus is on learning rather than building a robust, fault-tolerant system.

4. User Stories

1. As a new user, I want to create an account and log in to access the basic movie review and finder app.
